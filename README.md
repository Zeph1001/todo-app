To Do List Application

Overview:
This To Do List application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage their daily tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, view a list of existing tasks, and delete completed tasks. This application is designed to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts using Node.js and MongoDB.
Technologies Used

    Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for the server-side logic.
    Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node.
    MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store the tasks persistently.
    Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
    EJS: A templating language that generates HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's used here to template the front-end.
    CSS: Used for styling the web pages to make the user interface friendly and visually appealing.
